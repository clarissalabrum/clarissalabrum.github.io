# Clarissa Labrum

## Bio

I have a great passion for software development. I love problem solving, working as a team, and making something that works and looks great. I'm hoping to find an environment where everyone around me wants to be better and make things that are great.

Currently pursuing a Bachelors in Software Engineering at Utah Valley University. My desire is to find a job in full stack or front-end engineering and slowly work towards completing my degree and then completing a master’s degree.

I have completed a Bachelor’s degree at Utah State University. Majoring in Computational Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

## This Github

[My Github](https://github.com/clarissalabrum) account currently contains some projects completed at UVU and USU.

[CS 2410 Graphical User Interfaces](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2410/blob/master/README.md) This class focused on creating android apps using Android Studio and java.
The standout project of the class is the contacts app.

[CS 2420, Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420) repository contains different projects that involved using data structures to solve
different logical problems.

[Math 4610 Computational Mathematics](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610), [Math 5620 Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math5620), Assignments for these classes were in the form of tasksheets where sometimes different java projects were created to solve the problems. The courses required a Software Manual where every project was documented.
