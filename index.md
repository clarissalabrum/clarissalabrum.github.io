## Bio

One thing I know for sure is that I love problem solving. My degree in Computation Mathematics and Minor in Computer Science has given me a great foundation for a job in software development.

I am proficient in Java and have experience in other languages such as python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am ready to join the work field, continue to improve my skills and become part of a team to accomplish something great.

## This Github

[My Github](https://github.com/clarissalabrum) account currently contains projects that have been completed in previous courses taken at USU and Snow College.

[CS 2420, Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420) repository contains different projects that involved using data structures to solve
different logical problems.

[Math 5620 Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math5620). Assignments for this class were in the form of tasksheets where sometimes many java projects needed to be created to solve the problems. The course required a Software Manual where every project was documented. The link to the projects and software manual is below.
